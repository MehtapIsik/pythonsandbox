# Instructions

* Install nosetests, e.g. `conda install nose`
* In this directory, run `nosetests`
* Use `nosetests -v` to see which tests are being run
* Use `-a unit` to select specific tests using the attr ("attribute") decorator
* Use `-s` to output stdout (otherwise it is captured by nosetests).
